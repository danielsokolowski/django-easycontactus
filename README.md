django-easycontactus
====================

Plain, no bells or whistles skeleton contact us form with dynamic form content aggregation. 

This is not meant to be a stand alone app but rather a starting skeleton for your tailored contact us form. 
It is recommend you place it directly in your project and adjust accordingly. Emails are sent to addresses listed in
your 'MANAGERS' project setting and the body of the message automatically includes any new fields added trough
introspection.
